Bug Fixes
Until version 0.32 the action table had a small bug.  The third element of the
Actions array was employ as the code ref to be run when leaving a state.  This
is still supported for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated.  The
documentation specified the second element is to hold the action.  This is now
used (it was ignored before), and if not set, the third element is checked.
